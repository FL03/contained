***

Conduit is a simple command line interface designed for testing the proposed harmonic runtime which leverages the Neo-Riemannian Theory as a means of preserving the I/O from remote surfaces transformed according to some set of LPR transformations. This theory directly ties into to our desire to implement a dynamic encryption protocol combining fully-homomorphic encryption mechanisms with elliptic-curve cryptography, something more formally discussed under the guise of [aqueduct](https://github.com/scattered-systems/aqueduct).
