    Description:
        def. A tonetz is a conceptual lattice diagram traditionally used for spatially representing tonal distance and relationships.

        All triads are connected with a similar edge, sharing two common verticies or notes.
        This translates into a directed graph where each node points to an order pair of verticies.

        More so, the tonnetz will leverage a supersink and supersink
