    Description:
        def. A tonnetz is a conceptual lattice diagram traditionally used for spatially representing tonal distance and relationships.

        Computationally, the tonnetz will be constructed as some type of graph-based data-structure. This eliminates the need for establishing
        any particular topology and preserves the overall flexability of the system.
