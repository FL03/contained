    Description:
        def. A tonnetz is a conceptual lattice diagram traditionally used for spatially representing tonal distance and relationships.

        For our purposes, we specifcally consider the generalized tonnetz in a graph-based form of interconnected octahedrals which create a circle tied together by interconneted faces.
        This means that each device will run at least one "cell" where a cell is a circular graph
